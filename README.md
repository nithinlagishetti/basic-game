# basic-game 
This is a basic implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python. The program allows the user to play against the computer in a simple text-based interface.

The game operates by:
The user selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
The winner is determined based on the standard game rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
